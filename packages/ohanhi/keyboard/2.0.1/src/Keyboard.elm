# Msg and Update

Using Keyboard this way, you get all the help it can provide.
Use either this approach, or the plain subscriptions and handle the state yourself.

@docs Msg, subscriptions, update

**Note!** If the user presses a key combination that shifts focus, such as `Alt-Tab` or `Ctrl-L`,
some keys may get "stuck" in the keys list. One solution to this issue is to create a port subscription to the window `blur` events and clearing the entire key list from your model:

    // JavaScript
    window.onblur = function() { elmApp.ports.blurs.send({}) }

    -- Elm
    port blurs : (() -> msg) -> Sub msg

    subscriptions : Sub Msg
    subscriptions =
        Sub.batch
            [ Keyboard.subscriptions KeyboardMsg
            , blurs Blur
            ]


    -- update
        ...
        Blur ->
            { model | pressedKeys = [] }
        ...

If you prefer to only get "the facts" and do your own handling, use these

{-| This alternate update function answers the question: "Did the pressed down
keys in fact change just now?"

You might be wondering why this is a `Maybe KeyChange` &ndash; it's because
`keydown` events happen many times per second when you hold down a key. Thus,
not all incoming messages actually cause a change in the model. Also, you will
only get updates for the keys that match your `KeyParser`.
