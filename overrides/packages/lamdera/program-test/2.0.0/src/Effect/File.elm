{-| Decode `File` values. For example, if you want to create a drag-and-drop
file uploader, you can listen for `drop` events with a decoder like this:

    import File
    import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, list)

    files : Decode.Decoder (List File)
    files =
        field "dataTransfer" (field "files" (list File.decoder))

Once you have the files, you can use functions like [`File.toString`](#toString)
to process the content. Or you can send the file along to someone else with the
[`elm/http`](/packages/elm/http/latest) package.

-}
decoder : Decode.Decoder File
decoder =
    File.decoder |> Decode.map RealFile



-- CONTENT


{-| Extract the content of a `File` as a `String`. So if you have a `notes.md`
file you could read the content like this:

    import File exposing (File)
    import Task

    type Msg
        = MarkdownLoaded String

    read : File -> Cmd Msg
    read file =
        Task.perform MarkdownLoaded (File.toString file)

Reading the content is asynchronous because browsers want to avoid allocating
the file content into memory if possible. (E.g. if you are just sending files
along to a server with [`elm/http`](/packages/elm/http/latest) there is no
point having their content in memory!)

-}
toString : File -> Task FrontendOnly x String
toString file =
    FileToString (toInternalFile file) Succeed


{-| Extract the content of a `File` as `Bytes`. So if you have an `archive.zip`
file you could read the content like this:

    import Bytes exposing (Bytes)
    import File exposing (File)
    import Task

    type Msg
        = ZipLoaded Bytes

    read : File -> Cmd Msg
    read file =
        Task.perform ZipLoaded (File.toBytes file)

From here you can use the [`elm/bytes`](/packages/elm/bytes/latest) package to
work with the bytes and turn them into whatever you want.

-}
toBytes : File -> Task FrontendOnly x Bytes
toBytes file =
    FileToBytes (toInternalFile file) Succeed


{-| The `File.toUrl` function will convert files into URLs like this:

  - `data:*/*;base64,V2hvIGF0ZSBhbGwgdGhlIHBpZT8=`
  - `data:*/*;base64,SXQgd2FzIG1lLCBXaWxleQ==`
  - `data:*/*;base64,SGUgYXRlIGFsbCB0aGUgcGllcywgYm95IQ==`

This is using a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding to
turn arbitrary binary data into ASCII characters that safely fit in strings.

This is primarily useful when you want to show images that were just uploaded
because **an `<img>` tag expects its `src` attribute to be a URL.** So if you
have a website for selling furniture, using `File.toUrl` could make it easier
to create a screen to preview and reorder images. This way people can make
sure their old table looks great!

-}
toUrl : File -> Task FrontendOnly x String
toUrl file =
    FileToUrl (toInternalFile file) Succeed



-- METADATA


{-| Get the name of a file.

    name file1 == "README.md"

    name file2 == "math.gif"

    name file3 == "archive.zip"

-}

name file =

        RealFile file_ ->
            File.name file_

        MockFile file_ ->
            file_.name


{-| Get the MIME type of a file.

    mime file1 == "text/markdown"

    mime file2 == "image/gif"

    mime file3 == "application/zip"

-}
mime : File -> String
mime file =
    case file of
        RealFile file_ ->
            File.mime file_

        MockFile file_ ->
            file_.mimeType


{-| Get the size of the file in bytes.

    size file1 == 395

    size file2 == 65813

    size file3 == 81481

-}
size : File -> Int
size file =
    case file of
        RealFile file_ ->
            File.size file_

        MockFile file_ ->
            case file_.content of

                StringFile text ->
                    Bytes.Encode.string text |> Bytes.Encode.encode |> Bytes.width


{-| Get the time the file was last modified.

    lastModified file1 -- 1536872423

    lastModified file2 -- 860581394

    lastModified file3 -- 1340375405

[`elm/time`](/packages/elm/time/latest) package!
